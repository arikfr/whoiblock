h1. Who I Block? (on Twitter)

This is a simple Rails app that uses Twitter's API & OAuth to show you who you block on Twitter. You can see it working here: "http://whoiblock.heroku.com/":http://whoiblock.heroku.com/ .

This app is super simple (1 controller, 3 methods) and I probably should've used Sinatra to create it, but - I had the same app created in PHP few months ago and decided to port it to Rails as an exercise. 

If you plan deploying this app, don't forget to update the consumer secret & key in config/initializers/config.rb.

h2. Thanks
