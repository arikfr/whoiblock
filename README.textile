h1. Who I Block? (on Twitter)

This is a simple Rails app that uses Twitter's API & OAuth to show you who you block on Twitter. 

This app is super simple (1 controller, 3 methods) and I probably should've used Sinatra to create it, but - I had the same app created in PHP few months ago and decided to port it to Rails, as a study exercise. 

h2. Thanks
